        <h2>Insurance in the Philippines is ripe for disruption.</h2>
        <p>Despite insurance being a giant industry in the Philippines, life insurance penetration remains low. This is because of how much this sector is technologically underdeveloped. As a result, people delay getting insurance because they find the whole process difficult and frustrating.</p>
        <p>How might we make the process easier for Filipinos? Enter InsurePlus: a special membership program where people can get life insurance from all the top providers in the country.</p>
        <p>As an intern, I was asked to become the startup&#x27;s first (and only) designer; I became responsible for its branding and end-to-end experience.</p>
        <h2>I had to ensure that InsurePlus was seen as unique yet credible.</h2>
        <p>First, I helped facilitate a brand sprint on Miro. The team had to conceptualize what they thought the startup&#x27;s values and relationships were, along with its positioning and messaging. What we discovered is that we wanted to position InsurePlus as the polar opposite our competitors; if the industry giants were seen as classic and reserved, we wanted to be expressive and modern.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:1923pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/brand-sprint.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
        </figure>
        <p>Once I had a sense of what InsurePlus was, I began doing explorations through moodboards and logo iterations. Aside from our competitors, I also took inspiration from video games, particularly RPGs. This was thanks to the plus in the name and the shield symbol. I wanted to make it seem like InsurePlus could level up the customer&#x27;s life. In the end, we settled on a shield with a plus sign that looked like a keypad.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:1920pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/Moodboard.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
        </figure>
        <p>‍</p>
        <figure style="max-width:2793pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/Logo-Exploration.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>

          <div><img src="../images/logo.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
        </figure>
        <p>After creating InsurePlus&#x27; look, I then had to figure out to promote the startup. I went back to analyzing our competitors. After scanning their social media accounts, I noticed these patterns: vector illustrations, mostly light color schemes (i.e. white + other main colors), and colored photos of people. So in order to stand out, I decided to be bold and take the opposite approach with design: dark color schemes with black &amp; white photos.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:1831pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/Competitor-Feeds.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
        </figure>
        <p>For our social media content, I designed and helped write copy. We discovered that the best performing posts were educational carousels on basic insurance topics, which helped us establish ourselves as an authority in the field.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:1920pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/Educational-Pubmats.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
        </figure>
        <h2>We pivoted again and again, trying to find product-market fit.</h2>
        <p>Initially, our value proposition was offering rewards with insurance. Our early ads highlighted this, along with other perks (e.g. free consultations).</p>
        <figure style="max-width:1920pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/Old-Ads-2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
        </figure>
        <figure style="max-width:1920pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/Old-Ads-1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
        </figure>
        <p>While this brought us tons of leads, many of them were of low quality; they&#x27;d be looking for free stuff, with no interest/knowledge in insurance. To filter them out, we had to explicitly put more information about our offerings.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:2160pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/newvideoads.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
        </figure>
        <p>Other changes I made to our ads were making them videos, along with shifting to a light color scheme (on request of my boss, who called the dark scheme &quot;dystopian-like&quot;). This improved their performance.</p>
        <figure style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-video">

        </figure>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>We also experimented with the tiering of our rewards. </p>
        <figure style="max-width:2396pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/Offer-Iterations.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
          <figcaption>From three tiers, to one tier, to even more tiers...</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Since we had limited space in our landing page, I created rewards catalogues that gave them an overall view of the tiers offered. Each had a short description of the target audience, along with important details like the minimum insurance premium required and insurance benefits. Individual tier pages enumerated a sample of rewards offered under it.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:1920pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">

          <figcaption>Catalogue covers; we had an overall one which we also segmented into tiers (depending on the customer)</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Individual tier pages</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>However, in order to avoid being accused of inducement, we ended up having to downplay rewards. This was also because of our user research, where we found out that people were more interested in learning about insurance over rewards.</p>

        <h3>LANDING PAGE Walkthrough</h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <figure style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-video">
          <div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKm0KYbrK90"></iframe></div>
        </figure>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Another insight we got was that people struggled to pick from our providers because they were difficult to differentiate. Their proposals weren&#x27;t user-friendly at all, being stuffed with verbose paragraphs and dense tables.</p>
        <h2>Then, I discovered a new value proposition: comparing proposals for our customers.</h2>
        <p>To tackle this, I suggested creating a proposal summary template. This collated the customer&#x27;s monthly budget (basis of the proposal) and a comparison matrix (i.e. product details, insurance premium, insurance benefits, investments) all into one page.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:1715px" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/comparisontemplate.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
          <figcaption>Proposal Summary template</figcaption>

          <figcaption>One-pager on rewards, attached after the proposal summary</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When we started sending these summaries out, response rates to our e-mails skyrocketed. However, this came at a cost; so many leads were asking for summaries, and the team struggle to deliver since they were still making these summaries manually. To make operations easier, I configured the templates to work with Google Sheets Sync. With this, the team no longer had to copy paste data from sheets into the templates; the whole process was automated for them.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:2709px" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/Process.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
          <figcaption>Overview of the process</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure style="padding-bottom:75%" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-video">
          <div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loom.com%2Fembed%2Fd09fd7961af643f393a2e10927cb162e&amp;display_name=Loom&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loom.com%2Fshare%2Fd09fd7961af643f393a2e10927cb162e&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.loom.com%2Fsessions%2Fthumbnails%2Fd09fd7961af643f393a2e10927cb162e-00001.gif&amp;key=96f1f04c5f4143bcb0f2e68c87d65feb&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=loom"></iframe></div>
        </figure>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Having found success, we started tweaking our ads and landing page to reflect this new value proposition.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:1920pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/Hero-Illustration.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
          <figcaption>Comparison of old and new hero illustrations; rewards v.s. proposal value proposition</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>What would the ideal InsurePlus look like?</h2>
        <p>Despite gaining traction, we were still operating sneakily due to our lack of regulation. This was difficult to keep up, so in late 2020, the team prepared a proposal for the Insurance Commission. In this proposal, InsurePlus was envisioned as an inexpensive web platform that automatically matches users looking for insurance with licensed financial advisors. Basically like Grab, but for buying insurance.</p>
        <p>Instead of containing a sign-up form, the landing page would connect to a new sign-up flow that immediately suggests users proposals based on their answers. If they wanted full access to these proposals, they would need to sign-up.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:1920pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/Sign-up-Flow.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
        </figure>
        <p>Once a user gets an account, they would be directed to a client portal. The dashboard immediately shows the status of their proposal request application. They can then see the advisors who proposed to them. Then, with the help of a Tinder-like UI, they can screen advisors. The user can check the advisor&#x27;s profile, along with their message and a proposal summary. Once the user matches with advisor, they will then be brought to a chat UI where the advisor can assist them until they close.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:1920pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/MyInsurance-dashboard.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
        </figure>
        <p>The agent experience is even simpler. Once they sign up, the agent can already choose prospects. After that, they just have to input proposal details, add a greeting message, and upload a PDF copy of the proposal.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:1951pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="../images/Agent-Experience.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></div>
        </figure>
        <p>Unfortunately, the proposal wasn&#x27;t approved by the Insurance Commission, so it had to be put on hold.</p>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Even if InsurePlus &quot;failed&quot;, I consider working on it a valuable learning experience. I learned not only more about an unsexy industry I knew nothing about, but also how startups were built and run. Being in a cross-functional team exposed me to the nitty-gritty; thanks to it, I became a better designer.</p>
        <h2>Thank You!</h2>
        <p>My mentor <strong>Avery</strong>, who first believed in me. Despite being an intern with minimal experience, he trusted me to lead a project on my own.</p>
        <p>Our digital marketer <strong>Keefe</strong>, who spearheaded our growth efforts. My creative outputs wouldn&#x27;t have fared as well without his work.</p>
        <p>Our project manager <strong>Bryan</strong>, who led the team throughout all the stress and ambiguity. I would&#x27;ve been lost without his industry knowledge and clear expectations.</p>
        <p>The rest of the team at Fluid Stack, from my co-interns to our boss Nix. All their support played a huge part in growing InsurePlus.</p>
